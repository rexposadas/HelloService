# HelloService
Services, written in different languages, talking to each other with as much tech as possible. 

This is meant to be a learning tool.

# Running the services locally

## Go

1. cd to the go directory
2. run `go run main.go`
3. If you want to set the port you can do so with `PORT=8081 go run main.go`

# Notes on the different implementations

## Go

Gin was used because it's one of the more common web frameworks. It's also very easy to use. We could have just as 
easily used the standard library, but I wanted to show how to use a framework.
