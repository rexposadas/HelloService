# Purpose of this directory

This is a demonstration of how to create a REST service using 
gin and simple basic stuff like testing and benchmarcking. 


You should be able to look at the code and see how things are done easily
since this are the simple cases. Start by looking at `main.go`


# Gettin started

Run `make test` to run the tests

Or simply `go test ./..`

# What's here

1. A simple REST service using gin
2. Look at logic.go for :
   3. Example of testing
   4. Examples of benchmarking
5. Makefile gives a simple way to run the test
