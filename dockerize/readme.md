# Running the app

In a terminal, build the image rexposadas/dockerize_example: 

    make docker_build 


The command above creates an image in the docker registery in your localhost.  If you run 

    docker images

you will see the following image: `rexposadas/dockerize_example`


Run the container

    make docker_run


In another terminal, make an HTTP call to the running container:
    
    curl http://localhost:8000/


You should get an HTTP 200 reponse
